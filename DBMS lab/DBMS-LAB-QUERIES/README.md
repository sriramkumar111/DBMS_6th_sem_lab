## Database Management System Laboratory - SQL Queries On Oracle SQL Server

Welcome to the Database Management System (DBMS) Laboratory at AOT. This README.md provides an overview of the queries conducted during Day 1 to last day of lab, encompassing fundamental CRUD operations and advanced SQL concepts.

### Overview
During the first day of the DBMS laboratory, students delved into a range of operations essential for managing relational databases. These operations included:

- **Create Table**: Crafting new database tables to store structured data.
- **Alter Table/Column**: Modifying existing table structures or columns to accommodate evolving requirements.
- **Update Table**: Making changes to the data within existing tables.
- **Drop/Delete/Truncate Table**: Removing tables or clearing their contents, depending on the specific requirements.
- **Select/DML Queries**: Retrieving, manipulating, and managing data within tables using Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
- **Join Operations**: Combining data from multiple tables based on specified relationships.
- **Aggregation Operations**: Performing calculations across sets of data, often used with functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
- **Datetime, Sysdate, Timestamp, NVL Operations**: Manipulating date/time data, handling null values, and working with various date/time functions.

### Exploration and Continuous Improvement
The laboratory sessions emphasize not only the execution of standard SQL operations but also the exploration and refinement of queries. Students are encouraged to engage deeply with SQL RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) concepts, refining their queries to address complex scenarios efficiently.

### Enhancing Query Complexity
As students progress through the laboratory sessions, they are challenged to tackle increasingly intricate SQL queries. By systematically breaking down and analyzing complex problems, they hone their skills in crafting precise and efficient SQL statements.

### Feedback and Contributions
Feedback and contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving existing queries or ideas for new ones, feel free to submit a pull request or reach out to the laboratory instructors.


Thank you for your interest in the DBMS Laboratory at AOT. Happy querying!
